| November 13 |   Classtime   |                                                                                                                                          I looked at BlickCompressor and BinaryStdIn and out to get a start. I do wonder why the two functions extract stuff from the input files in different ways. I don't understand why they do it in different ways. Anyways, for GenomeCompressor, Mr. Blick helped me realize that I don't need to store binary in my code, I just have to write to a file in binary. |
| November 14 | 9:00pm-9:30pm | I used Mr. Blicks BlickCommpressor as a basic skeleton on where to go and went from there. I got the functions done pretty quickly but I was trying to make compress work without a switch case but couldn't find anything better. When I started testing I realized I couldn't really debug or print. But then I realized that the print statements went to where the output went. With this, I got it to work mostly but between each character (the characters were right), there were 3 null characters. |
| November 16 | 11:15-11:30am |                                                                                                I looked at BinaryStdOut to find out where I went wrong and figured out that I was using the wrong write function. This made my code worked but with the small error that for some reason 3 A's were added to the end. I literally have no idea where these A's came from since my print statements weren't really helping much. I want to know how to debug with projects like these to help fix this error. |
