| November 13 |   Classtime   |                                                                                                                                        I looked at `BlickCompressor` and `BinaryStdIn` and out to get a start. I do wonder why the two functions extract stuff from the input files in different ways. I don't understand why they do it in different ways. Anyways, for GenomeCompressor, Mr. Blick helped me realize that I don't need to store binary in my code, I just have to write to a file in binary. |
| November 14 | 9:00pm-9:30pm | I used Mr. `Blicks BlickCommpressor` as a basic skeleton on where to go and went from there. I got the functions done pretty quickly but I was trying to make compress work without a switch case but couldn't find anything better. When I started testing I realized I couldn't really debug or print. But then I realized that the print statements went to where the output went. With this, I got it to work mostly but between each character (the characters were right), there were 3 null characters. |

This made my code worked but with the small error that for some reason 3 A's were added to the end. I literally have no idea where these A's came from since my print statements weren't really helping much. I want to know how to debug with projects like these to help fix this error. |

I knew that I was writing in an int which made things easier than the two bits for each nucleotide. I got it working but I was left wondering what to do now that I have the length of the original file in my expand method. |

This all makes conceptual sense now in the way where I understand why I need to do this. |
